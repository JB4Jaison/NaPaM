# Description
This plugin is for anyone familiar with coding in python and would like to create immediate visualizations of their data processing steps.

With the flexibility of napari, this plugin allows you to visualize your nD data and apply various filters and transformations to your data. With the freedom of using the python scripting language, you can create custom filters and transformations (which is what we call as a Macro here) to apply to your data whether it be 2D, 3D or even just a ROI of your 2D/3D data! Your imagination is the limit! You can even use existing python libraries and even custom made libraries to apply to your data.

# Inputs
The input to the plugin can be your label or image layer and the output will be the same layer with the applied filters or transformations.

# Why NaPaM?
We have the console, so why do we need another plugin? The console can be clunky if you want to write multiline python scripts and to edit the scripts. Instead of that we have the code area which works like a text editor where you can write your python scripts run and edit them. (Future release to have a smart code box that would help in understanding the coding language and provide syntax highlighting). You also can (as mentioned before) run it on just a custom ROI of your data.
